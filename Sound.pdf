# **Sound – Detailed Chapter Notes**

## 1. **Production of Sound**

* Sound is produced due to **vibrations** of objects.
* A vibrating object creates **disturbances in the surrounding medium** (usually air).
* Examples:

  * Guitar string → vibrates to produce sound.
  * Tuning fork → prongs vibrate.
  * Our voice → vocal cords vibrate.

---

## 2. **Propagation of Sound**

* Sound travels as a **mechanical wave** (requires a medium).
* Type: **Longitudinal wave** → particles vibrate **parallel** to direction of wave.
* Consists of **compressions (C)** (high pressure) and **rarefactions (R)** (low pressure).
* Cannot travel in **vacuum** (needs material medium like air, water, solid).

---

## 3. **Characteristics of Sound Waves**

* **Wavelength (λ):** Distance between two consecutive compressions/rarefactions.
* **Frequency (f):** Number of vibrations per second (unit: Hertz, Hz).
* **Time Period (T):** Time taken for one complete vibration. Relation: ( T = \frac{1}{f} ).
* **Amplitude (A):** Maximum displacement of vibrating particles → determines loudness.
* **Velocity (v):** Speed of sound in a medium. Relation:
  [
  v = f \times \lambda
  ]

## 4. **Speed of Sound**

* Depends on **medium and temperature**.
* Faster in solids, then liquids, slowest in gases.
* At (25^\circ C) in air: ~ **346 m/s**.

## 5. **Range of Hearing**

* **Human ear:** 20 Hz – 20,000 Hz (audible range).
* **Infrasonic (< 20 Hz):** e.g., vibrations during earthquakes, elephant communication.
* **Ultrasonic (> 20,000 Hz):** e.g., bats, dolphins use ultrasound for echolocation.

---

## 6. **Reflection of Sound**

* Sound obeys **laws of reflection** (like light).
* Applications:

  * **Megaphones** (direct sound).
  * **Stethoscope** (doctor listens heartbeat).
  * **Echo** → repetition of sound due to reflection (time gap ≥ 0.1 sec, distance ≥ 17.2 m in air).
  * **SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging):** Uses ultrasound to detect objects under water.

---

## 7. **Characteristics of Musical Sound**

* **Loudness:** Depends on amplitude.
* **Pitch:** Depends on frequency (shrillness or deepness).
* **Quality (Timbre):** Distinguishes sounds of same pitch and loudness (e.g., flute vs guitar).

## 8. **Applications of Ultrasound**

* **Medical imaging:** Sonography to detect fetus.
* **Cleaning:** Fine holes in machines cleaned using ultrasound.
* **Industrial use:** Detect cracks in metals.

---

## 9. **Structure of Human Ear**

* **Outer Ear (Pinna & Ear Canal):** Collects sound waves.
* **Eardrum (Tympanic Membrane):** Vibrates with sound.
* **Middle Ear (Three bones – hammer, anvil, stirrup):** Amplifies vibrations.
* **Inner Ear (Cochlea):** Converts vibrations into electrical signals.
* **Auditory Nerve:** Carries signals to brain for interpretation.

✅ **In Short**:

* Sound is a mechanical, longitudinal wave produced by vibrations.
* Travels through medium by compressions & rarefactions.
* Has properties like frequency, amplitude, wavelength, speed.
* Human hearing range is 20 Hz – 20 kHz.
* Reflection gives rise to echo & SONAR.
* Ultrasound has wide applications.
* Ear is the sense organ for hearing.
